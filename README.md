# This policy will automatically assign itself to stacks and is used to trigger stacks directly from the `cloudposse/github-action-atmos-affected-trigger-spacelift` GitHub action
# This is only used if said GitHub action is set to trigger on "comments"
"GIT_PUSH Plan Affected":
  type: GIT_PUSH
  labels:
    - autoattach:pr-comment-triggered
  body: |
    package spacelift

    # This policy runs whenever a comment is added to a pull request. It looks for the comment body to contain either:
    # /spacelift preview input.stack.id
    # /spacelift deploy input.stack.id
    #
    # If the comment matches those patterns it will queue a tracked run (deploy) or a proposed run (preview). In the case of
    # a proposed run, it will also cancel all of the other pending runs for the same branch.
    #
    # This is being used on conjunction with the GitHub actions `atmos-trigger-spacelift-feature-branch.yaml` and
    # `atmos-trigger-spacelift-main-branch.yaml` in .github/workflows to automatically trigger a preview or deploy run based
    # on the `atmos describe affected` output.

    track {
    	commented
    	contains(input.pull_request.comment, concat(" ", ["/spacelift", "deploy", input.stack.id]))
    }

    propose {
    	commented
    	contains(input.pull_request.comment, concat(" ", ["/spacelift", "preview", input.stack.id]))
    }

    # Ignore if the event is not a comment
    ignore {
    	not commented
    }

    # Ignore if the PR has a `spacelift-no-trigger` label
    ignore {
    	input.pull_request.labels[_] = "spacelift-no-trigger"
    }

    # Ignore if the PR is a draft and deesnt have a `spacelift-trigger` label
    ignore {
    	input.pull_request.draft
    	not has_spacelift_trigger_label
    }

    has_spacelift_trigger_label {
    	input.pull_request.labels[_] == "spacelift-trigger"
    }

    commented {
    	input.pull_request.action == "commented"
    }

    cancel[run.id] {
    	run := input.in_progress[_]
    	run.type == "PROPOSED"
    	run.state == "QUEUED"
    	run.branch == input.pull_request.head.branch
    }

    # This is a random sample of 10% of the runs
    sample {
      millis := round(input.request.timestamp_ns / 1e6)
      millis % 100 <= 10
    }
```

This policy will automatically attach itself to _all_ components that have the `pr-comment-triggered` label, already
defined in `stacks/orgs/NAMESPACE/_defaults.yaml` under `settings.spacelift.labels`.

Next, create two new GitHub Action workflows:

```diff
+ .github/workflows/atmos-trigger-spacelift-feature-branch.yaml
+ .github/workflows/atmos-trigger-spacelift-main-branch.yaml
```

The feature branch workflow will create a comment event in Spacelift to run a Proposed run for a given stack. Whereas
the main branch workflow will create a comment event in Spacelift to run a Deploy run for those same stacks.

#### Feature Branch

```yaml
name: "Plan Affected Spacelift Stacks"

on:
  pull_request:
    types:
      - opened
      - synchronize
      - reopened
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  context:
    runs-on: ["self-hosted"]
    steps:
      - name: Atmos Affected Stacks Trigger Spacelift
        uses: cloudposse/github-action-atmos-affected-trigger-spacelift@v1
        with:
          atmos-config-path: ./rootfs/usr/local/etc/atmos
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

This will add a GitHub comment such as:

```
/spacelift preview plat-ue1-sandbox-foobar
```

#### Main Branch

```yaml
name: "Deploy Affected Spacelift Stacks"

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [closed]
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  run:
    if: github.event.pull_request.merged == true
    runs-on: ["self-hosted"]
    steps:
      - name: Atmos Affected Stacks Trigger Spacelift
        uses: cloudposse/github-action-atmos-affected-trigger-spacelift@v1
        with:
          atmos-config-path: ./rootfs/usr/local/etc/atmos
          deploy: true
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          head-ref: ${{ github.sha }}~1
```

This will add a GitHub comment such as:

```
/spacelift deploy plat-ue1-sandbox-foobar
```
